<p align="center">
A short command line npm readme package that's pretty useless.
<br>but it links to my socials, work and a kitten cam so... that's a bonus?

### Publishing as an npm/github package

#### np

I use [`np`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/np) by sindresorhus to manage my package releases.
<br>It's better than `npm install` and creates draft release notes for you.

- Use the following command to install.
- Note: Remove `--global` if you want to only install it locally for your repo.

```sh
npm install --global np
```

#### Workflow Action

If you don't want to use `np`

- Enable the workflow `cli-release` & `cli-test`.
- Run the workflows whenever you want to push from github to npm & github packages.

Note: make sure you manually update `package.json` & `package-lock.json`.
